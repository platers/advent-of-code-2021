# Advent of Code 2021

First time using rust! Later days may run slow.

Run a file with `cargo run --bin day01a`. Inputs should be copied into `input.txt`. Some problems have my input hardcoded.

## Memorable Days

- Day 18: [Day 18](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/18)
  - Could not figure out how to traverse a binary tree nicely. Ended up using a simpler data structure.
- Day 22: [Day 22](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/22)
  - Overly clever solution using recursive sweep line, which somehow worked on the first try.
